		\subsection{Description of the given problem}
			The system we are going to develop is a car–sharing service called \textit{PowerEnJoy}. The system allows registered users to locate and reserve a car to use.

		\subsection{Goals}
			% this should be adjusted and numbered as soon as everybody has made them
			\begin{itemize}
				%% Pat's part %%
				% TODO

				%% Madda's part %%
				\item \textbf{G1} The system charges the user for a predefined amount of money per minute.
				\item \textbf{G2} The system starts charging the user as soon as the car ignites.
				\item \textbf{G3} The system stops charging the user when the car is parked in a safe area and the user exits the car. The user must confirm the operation, otherwise the system keeps charging them. 
				\item \textbf{G4} A screen on the car notifies the user of the current charges.
				\item \textbf{G5} The system locks the car automatically when the user exits the car. 
				\item \textbf{G6} The system allows the user to open the car through a bluetooth system when the user has reserved it.
				\item \textbf{G8} If the user has chosen to keep being charged, the system allows them to exit and close and re-open the car through a bluetooth system.
				\item \textbf{G9} If the user has chosen to stop being charged, the system keeps a 10–minutes window of time when they are allowed to re-open the car if it has not already been reserved by someone else.
				\item \textbf{G10} The set of safe parking areas is pre–defined by the management system.
				\item \textbf{G11} The system allows the user to earn a 10\% discount on the current ride if there are at least two other passengers in the car.

				% TODO
			\end{itemize}

		\subsection{Domain properties}
			% TODO
			
			We assume that the following properties hold in the analyzed world:			
			
			% madda's part (kinda -> whatever comes to mind)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item All cars are equipped and located with a GPS system.
				\item All the GPS always give the right position.
				\item The GPS system cannot be switched off.
				\item All cars are equipped with a Bluetooth system.
				\item The Bluetooth system is always on.
				\item When a user reserves a car, they always use it. %Do they, DO THEY??? 
				\item The safe areas are predefined and within the municipality of Milan.
				\item The payment of all services is always accepted. %We're assuming here that the credit card works and has credit, and also that the payment system never breaks. Too much?
				\item The cars always ignite when they are charged %Again, too much? We're assuming the cars never break...
				\item The cars cannot be reserved by more than one user at any given time. %is this a domain property?
				\item The system is always able to tell how many people occupy a car.
