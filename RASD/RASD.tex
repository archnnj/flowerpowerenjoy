	\section{Introduction}
		\subsection{Purpose}
			The document you're approaching to read is the \textit{Requirement Analysis and Specification Document} (from now on RASD) for the information system \textit{PowerEnJoy}. The purpose of this document is to describe, with varying degrees of depth and detail, the system we're going to implement. The system will be described firstly by listing the needs of our stakeholders (Goals section). From these goals we'll derive the functional and nonfunctional requirements (requirements section) needed to describe the system, and we'll also underline the constraints (constraints section) and limits of the software given by the world in which it operates (domain properties section). We'll then proceed to describe a series of scenarios and use cases that will probably occur after deployment.  
			
		\subsection{Actual system}
			The team has been asked to develop the system for a car sharing service. We suppose that nothing has been create until now and that we do not have to modify or expand any pre-existing application. We will have instead to create the entire system.
		
		\subsection{Scope}
			The system we are going to develop is a carâ€“sharing service called \textit{PowerEnJoy}, based on mobile application and which has a website. 
			The main functionality of the system will be to allow its users to locate and reserve a car to drive in the municipality of Milan and its surroundings using the mobile application. The users may choose to either search for cars in their whereabouts or near a given address, and can drive it inside the geographical boundaries set by the company. 
			Furthermore, the system will be developed such that the users will be encouraged in their good behaviours with discounts and sanctions to the fare per minute.
			Naturally, the system must also allow the registration of new users; for the registration the system requests both personal and payment information. Then, to complete registration, any guest must send a pdf with driving license and personal ID to the company's email to be validated. 
			All back-end operations are managed by one or more system administrators, who can dispatch on-site operators for emergencies, validate registrations, ban users. The administrators also have the possibility to choose some of the parameters of the system.

		\subsection{Constrains}
			\subsubsection{Regulatory policies}
				According to privacy law the system must require the User to give permission before getting his position and before acquiring, storing and processing his personal data.
			
			\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Mobile application
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Space for app package
							\item 3G connection
							\item GPS
						\end{itemize}
					\item Website
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Modern browser: the Website of the service must work with all versions of Google Chrome, Opera, Firefox and Internet Explorer released after 2010.	
						\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
			
			
			\subsubsection{Interfaces to other applications}
			\textit{PowerEnJoy} has to interface with the payment service application in order to invoice users for the rides. 
						

		\subsection{Identifying stakeholders}
			Main stakeholders are the inhabitants of Milan willing to use an ecologic and comfortable mean of transport, without the need to buy and maintain a personal car.
			The system can be adopted in any other city, so the inhabitants of other cities too can become stakeholders.
			In Milan, the project is promoted and participated my the city council as minor investor.

	\section{Actors identifying}
		The system involves as main external actors:
		\begin{description}
			\item[User] The final target of the system. Once registered, they can reserve a car and use it in respect of the agreements established with \textit{PowerEnJoy}. They are charged for the usage of the car.

			\item[Guest] A potential user not registered in the system yet.
		\end{description}
		The following actors have also been identified inside \textit{PowerEnJoy} as needed by the system:
		\begin{description}
			\item[Admin] Back-office administrators, they have access to a control panel.

			\item[Operator] Maintenance operators who provide field-based assistance and ensures cars are always ready to be used.

		\end{description}
		The system has moreover to interact with the following external service provider:
		\begin{description}
			\item[Payment service] Provider of every service related to users payment management.

		\subsection{Used tools}
		For this assignment, we used the following tools:
		
		\begin{description}
			\item [Alloy] We used the alloy tool to write the code and check the models for the specification.
			\item [LaTeX] The group used LaTeX to structure the final document and to help with versioning.
			\item [Github] We leaned on Github for versioning and coordinating synchronized work.
			\item [Toggl] We used toggl to keep track of work hours.
			\item [Slack] We used Slack for messaging and coordinating between us.
			
		\end{description}
		
		\subsection{Hours of work}
			\begin{description}
				\item[Abbud, Patricia] around 25 hours of work;
				\item[Andreoli Andreoni, Maddalena] around 54 hours of work;
				\item[Cudrano, Paolo] around 68 hours of work.
			\end{description}
