  \section{Introduction}
		\subsection{Description of the given problem}

The system we are going to develop is a car–sharing service called \textit{PowerEnJoy}. The system allows registered users to locate and reserve a car to use.

	\section{Goals}
	
		
	% MADDA'S PART
	
	% this should be adjusted and numbered as soon as everybody has made them
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{G1} The system charges the user for a predefined amount of money per minute.
		\item \textbf{G2} The system starts charging the user as soon as the car ignites.
		\item \textbf{G3} The system stops charging the user when the car is parked in a safe area and the user exits the car. % what happens if the user doesn't exit the car? And if the car is not parked in a safe area?
		\item \textbf{G4} A screen on the car notifies the user of the current charges.
		\item \textbf{G5} The system locks the car when the user exits the car. %independently from the place where it is parked? It doesn't make sense to NOT lock it if it's not in a safe space
		\item \textbf{G6} The set of safe parking areas is pre–defined by the management system.
		\item \textbf{G7} The system allows the user to earn a 10\% discount on the current ride if there are at least two other passengers in the car % "on the last ride" doesn't make sense...
