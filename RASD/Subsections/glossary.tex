				% FIXME check if these are now ok:
				\item[Discount] A discount is a deduction of a given percentage from the standard price. It is applied every time a user has a virtuous behavior. % A discount always lowers the price per minute charged to a user. It is a negative percentage that is applied every time a user has a virtuous behaviour.
				\item[Sanction] A sanction is an increase of a given percentage to the standard price. It is applied every time a user has a wasteful or incorrect behavior. % always increases the price per minute charged to a user. It is a positive percentage that is applied every time a user has a wasteful or incorrect behaviour.
				
				\item[Money saving option] An option offered to the users by the system. The user inputs their final destination and the system indicates them the best close station where to leave the car.
