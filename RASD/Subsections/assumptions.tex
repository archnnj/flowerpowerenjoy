The assignment document was unclear and ambiguous on some points of the specifications. Hence, we will make the following assumptions:
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Parking areas and special parking areas are two different things; however, common sense suggests that it isn't logical to charge users if they plug the car to the power grid in a recharging area but are not parked in a safe area. Neither it makes sense to sanction them if they park it in a safe area that is 3 km far from the power grid. Having the two areas separate would lead to the consequences above, so we decided that while a safe area may not be a recharging area, recharging areas are always safe areas. % not clear the part "Neither it makes sense to sanction them if they park it in a safe area that is 3 km far from the power grid.": I think this can actually happen and was just discussed after this was written: is that correct? :)
				Furthermore, assuming that a city has many safe areas, so that users can enjoy the service all around the city, it is reasonable to think that just a few of them have been equipped with a power grid connection, for economic and infrastructural reasons.
				
				\item The users are able to reserve an available car only from their geographical region. %It wasn't clear from the assignments document whether the user would be able to reserve a specific car; we assume so. %FIXIT actually depends on how Pat decides to formulate her part of the goals
				
				\item There is a "manual" way to close and open the car, i.e. that the user is allowed to temporarily park the car – while still being charged –, get out, close the car, and then get back and open it again. This means that the system can be used not only for one-way travels, but also when more stops or a round trip is needed.
				
				\item Parking areas and special parking areas are allotted and private parking spaces owned by \textit{PowerEnJoy} and distributed throughout the urban area. %discuss.
				
				\item We assume that all cars are the same model and have the same features; specifically, they are all 5-door Citroën C-Zero Micro Car with four seats, customized for the purposes of \textit{PowerEnJoy}. %https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_i-MiEV
