\subsection{Functional requirements}
We assume that all domain properties stipulated in paragraph 1.6 hold. We decided to use a \textit{goal-driven} method to structure our requirements, meaning that we decomposed the high-level goals of paragraph 1.5 into low-level requirements.
Some of these requirements stem directly from the requests of our clients, while others are born from the necessity to have a sound system.

For each goal, we derive the following requirements:


%MEDIUM LEVEL
\begin{itemize}


				\item [G1] Registration procedure %The system allows guests to register; to complete the registration procedure the system sends a password to the guest as an access key.
					\begin{itemize}
						\item The system has to allow any person to submit only one account request.
						\item The account is created when an admin validates all the necessary data. %TODO add email with license to the domain properties
						\item The system must be able to generate passwords.
						\item The system has to send a newly generated password to the user via email when the account is created.
						\item The system must be able to check whether a password is correct or not.
						\item The system must let the user log in only if the password is correct. 
						\item The system has to generate a new password and send it via email if the user asks for it.
					\end{itemize}

				\item [G2] Finding cars %The system should enable a registered user to find the location of an available car within a certain distance from the user's location or from a specified address.
					\begin{itemize}
						\item The system must have the ability to locate the user.
						\item The system must be able to locate any valid address.
						\item The system must be able to find any of the parking areas of the company. 
						\item The system must be able to identify available cars inside parking areas.
						\item The system must let users see whether there are available cars in a specified radius. %XXX
					\end{itemize}
				\item [G3] Reservation %The system enables user to reserve a single available car in a certain geographical region for one hour before the user picks it up. If the car is not picked up by that time, the reservation expires, the system tags this car as available again and it charges the user a fine of 1 EUR.
					\begin{itemize}
						\item The system must allow users to reserve an available car.
						\item The cars cannot be reserved by more than one user at any given time.
						\item The system must keep the current reservation standing until the user has opened the car or an hour has passed.
						\item The system must be able to autonomously cancel reservations.
						%TODO others?
					\end{itemize}
					
					
				\item [G4] Use of a car %The system should allow the user to employ a car in a proper and safe way. 
					\begin{itemize}
						\item The system must be able to locate any car at any given time with sufficient precision. %FIXME sufficient

						\item The system must allow the user to lock and unlock their car manually when outside a safe area.
						\item The system must provide a finite time window that begins when the user exits the car inside a safe area. The time window must either end when the allotted time is finished or when another user reserves the same car.
						\item The system must allow the user to re-enter the car while the time window is still open. 
					\end{itemize}
					
				\item [G5] Charges %The system charges the user for a predefined amount of money per minute. A screen on the car notifies the user of the current charges.
					\begin{itemize}

						\item The system should notify the user of the fee per minute he's being charged through a screen inside the car.
					\end{itemize}

					\begin{itemize}
						\item The system must be able to tell when the car has ignited. 
						\item The system should start counting the charges from the ignition onward. %FIXME horridly put.
						\item The system must ask the user whether they wish to end the ride or not as soon as they are parked in a safe area and have exited the car; if they decide so, the system should stop charging them, otherwise it should keep doing so. 
					\end{itemize}
				\item [G7] Discounts 
					\begin{itemize}
						\item The system must apply a discount every time a user brings two or more passengers in the car with them.
						\item The system must apply a discount every time the car has more than 50\% of power charge by the end of the ride. %FIXME horridly put
						\item The system must be able to apply a discount every time the user plugs the car in the power grid while their time window is still open.
					\end{itemize}
				\item [G8] Sanctions
					\begin{itemize}
						\item The system must apply a sanction every time a car is returned in a safe area at more than 3 km from the nearest recharging safe area.
						\item The system must apply a sanction every time a car is returned with less than 20\% of power charge.

				\item [G9] Money saving option

\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
	\subsubsection{User interface}
	\paragraph{}The interface of our application is thought to be used mainly via mobile app, with some content also displayed in a web page. The team reasoned that the main functionalities of the system (such as reserving and managing a car) make sense only in a \textit{movable} context (meaning, such that the user can do them anywhere they have an internet connection). Those functionalities are available on the mobile app. On the other hand, operations such as signing up are more easily managed in front of a computer, so the web page allows users to register, login and manage their profiles (which they can do also via mobile app anyway).
	\paragraph{}We pondered on the possibility of adding the possibility of reserving a car via web browser. However, upon consideration, we decided it is not a good mechanism: with that functionality, a user could very well be registered without having downloaded the app and reserving a car without being able to access it in any way. Hence, the reservation of \textit{PowerEnJoy} cars can be made only via mobile app.

Picture 1.b shows the user view. The user has more functionalities: they can look for cars in their vicinity or near an address, see and edit their profile, and changing settings (notification and sound settings).

	\paragraph{Documentation}
	\paragraph{} In order to keep track of all phases of the development process and the overall structure of the system, the team will release the following documents:
		\begin{description}
			\item[RASD], Requirement Analysis and Specification Document, which provides a thorough description of the system, the requirements and the specification thanks to the use of UML models.
			\item[DD], Design Document, which contains a more in-depth description of the functionalities of the system.
			\item[ITPD], Integration Test Plan Document, which describes integration tests and the team's intended plan to accomplish them.
			\item[PP], Project Plan, which defines a planning for the development project.
			
			%do we need those last two???
