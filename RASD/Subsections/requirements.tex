\subsection{Functional requirements}
We assume that all domain properties stipulated in paragraph 1.6 hold. Thus we can derive the following functional requirements in order to fulfill the goals listed in paragraph 1.5.

For each goal, we derive the following requirements:


%VERY HIGH LEVEL

\begin{itemize}
	\item [G1] The system allows guests to register; to complete the registration procedure the system sends a password to the guest as an access key.

			\item The system has to send a newly generated password to the user via email when prompted by the admin.
			\item The system must be able to check whether a password is correct or not.
			\item The system must let the user log in only if the password is correct. 		
		\end{itemize}
	\item [G2] The system should enable a registered user to find the location of an available car near a given location, reserve it and use it for a predefined amount of money per minute. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The system must be able to locate the user through their smartphone's GPS.
			\item The system must be able to find a specific address in its map. %FIXME horridly put.
			\item The system must be able to find parking areas in a given area of the map. 
			\item The system must be able to identify available cars inside parking areas.
			\item The system must let users see whether there are available cars in a specified radius.

			\item The system should allow the user exit, lock and unlock the car manually while still being charged.
			%these are endless...
		\end{itemize}
	\item [G3] The system should encourage good user behaviour and discourage bad behaviour through the application of discounts and sanctions to the fee per minute. 
	\item [G4] The system should aid the people working at PowerEnJoy in the execution of their jobs by keeping a channel of communication open between them and the users for emergencies and by keeping track of all activities of its cars.  
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}



\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
	\subsubsection{User interface}
	The interface of our application is thought to be used mainly via mobile app, with some content also displayed in a web page. The team reasoned that the main functionalities of the system (such as reserving and managing a car) make sense only in a \textit{movable} context (meaning, such that the user can do them anywhere they have an internet connection). Those functionalities are available on the mobile app. On the other hand, operations such as signing up are more easily managed in front of a computer, so the web page allows users to register, login and manage their profiles (which they can do also via mobile app anyway). \\
	We pondered on the possibility of adding the possibility of reserving a car via web browser. However, upon consideration, we decided it is not a good mechanism: with that functionality, a user could very well be registered without having downloaded the app and reserving a car without being able to access it in any way. Hence, the reservation of \textit{PowerEnJoy} cars can be made only via mobile app.
