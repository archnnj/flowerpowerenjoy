\subsection{Functional Requirements}
We assume that all domain properties stipulated in paragraph 1.6 hold. Thus we can derive the following functional requirements in order to fulfill the goals listed in paragraph 1.5.

For each goal, we derive the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
	\item [G1] Registration of a guest to the system.%\textbf{G1} Guest are able to register to the System. Each guest must fill a profile to become a user.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The system has to allow any person to sign up. %FIXME only from website: must say here?
		\end{itemize}
	\item [G2] Access to the system %\textbf{G2} To complete the procedure of registration the system sends a password to the guest as an access key.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The system has to send a newly generated password to the user via email when prompted by the admin.
			\item The system must be able to check whether a password is correct or not.
			\item The system must let the user log in only if the password is correct. 
		\end{itemize}
	\item [G3] Finding cars % \item \textbf{G3} The system enables the registered user to find the locations of an available car within a certain distance from the user's location or from a specified address.
		\begin{itemize}

	\item [G4] Reservation of a car %The system enables user to reserve a single available car in a certain geographical region for one hour before the user picks it up.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The system must allow users to reserve an available car.
