\subsection{Functional Requirements}
We assume that all domain properties stipulated in paragraph 1.6 hold. Thus we can derive the following functional requirements in order to fulfill the goals listed in paragraph 1.5.

\begin{itemize}
	\item [G1]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item goal
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
