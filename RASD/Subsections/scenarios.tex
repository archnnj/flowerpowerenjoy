\subsection{Scenario 1: Registration from the website}
	Anakin has just moved to Milan and has rented a flat; however, he couldn't afford a place close to the city centre, where he works; he also doesn't have a car, so he's been going back and forth with public transport. Because of that, he needs to wake up half an hour earlier and usually gets home very late, and he's getting tired. He then decides to look for a solution on Google, and he finds the car–sharing service of \textit{PowerEnJoy}, which has a parking place close to his home. The \textit{PowerEnJoy} web page has all the information readily available, pricing, features, an approximated map of the parking areas included and a link to download the application from suitable store, so Anakin decides to sign up. He completes a form, where he writes his complete name, personal information, information about his driving license, credentials and payment; the system checks Anakin's driving license and only then sends him the password, so he can login from the phone application and access the private area of the system. 

\subsection{Scenario 1: Registration from the mobile application}
	Chewbacca was advised the \textit{PowerEnJoy}, so he finds the application on the mobile appstore and downloads it directly to his phone. Opening the application he sees the main page where he can register just as his friend Anakin.  
		
\subsection{Scenario 2: Login in the app}
	Padmé has registered on the \textit{PowerEnJoy} website and now has downloaded the application on her smartphone. Opening the application, she finds a screen asking her to log in. Padmé registered with \textit{Naboo\_princess} username, and the password she received in her email is \textit{7aKmm93s}, so she fills the login form with this information. The first time she writes the password wrong, so the login is rejected and the application asks her to try again. The second time she typed the password right, so the system accepts the login and shows the main page of the application.
	
\subsection{Scenario 3: Reserving and using a car}
	Luke must reach his aunt and uncle for the usual sunday roast. He doesn't have a car, and usually he just takes the subway. However today the public transport workers are on strike, and the metro is out of order. Luke is a distracted kid, always with his head in the clouds, so he forgot about the strike and has walked for the fifteen minutes needed to reach the metro. He is nevertheless smart and resourceful, and so he remembers that he's signed in the \textit{PowerEnJoy} system. He opens the app and presses the "find car" button. He has the GPS activated, so the system locates him and tells him that there's a parking area with an available car next to the metro station. The application gives him the choice of reserving the car or cancel the operation, and Luke reserves the car. 
	
\subsection{Scenario 4: Parking and regular fees}
	Leia needs to get to the american consulate ASAP. She's a frequent user of the car–sharing service, so she already knows all the safe areas where she can park around the diplomatic block in the city centre, since she often needs to go there. While she drives, the smart display in her car tells her how much the system is currently charging: the fee per minute is 0,50 EUR, and she's been driving for half an hour, so her fee currently is 15 EUR. She reaches the diplomatic area after two more minutes, and she knows that the parking area is around the corner from the consulate, so she reaches there. This particular safe area is not a recharging area, and Leia left the car with a 60\% battery full, so the system charges her 16 EUR. The display notifies her that she's parked in a safe area and that no sanction applies to her fee. The system also asks her if she wants to keep the car reserved and keep being charged, and she declines. She exits the car and the system locks it automatically. 
	
\subsection{Scenario 5: Power grid and discounted fees}
	
\subsection{Scenario 5: Parking and sanctioned fees}
	Han, Leia's husband, is also a regular user of the system. He's however less abiding to rules and is a bit of a free spirit, so he generally never gains any discount and is often sanctioned for wasteful behaviour. For example, last monday he needed to reach his bank in Porta Genova for a meeting with his broker. He was very late, so he parked right outside the bank, outside any safe area. It took him twenty minutes to get there, so the system had charged him 10 EUR. As soon as he stops the car, the display notifies him that .

\subsection{Scenario 5: Lost reservation}
	Han and Leia want to go a restaurant. Han thinks that they are about to leave the house, so he decides to reserve a car sitting home to make sure they will have a car after leaving home, but it took Leia more than an hour to get prepared. In one hour they were not near the car to open it, so the system canceled Han's reservation, notified him about that and asked if he wants to reserve another available car.
