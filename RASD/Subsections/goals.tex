% this should be adjusted and numbered as soon as everybody has made them
			\begin{itemize}
				%% Pat's part %%
				\item \textbf{G1} Guest are able to register to the System. Each guest must fill a profile to become a user. %FIXME delete last sentence?
				\item \textbf{G2} To complete the procedure of registration the system sends a password to the guest as an access key. %FIXME plus the user must be able to log into the system with this password?
				\item \textbf{G3} The system should enable a registered user to find the location of an available car within a certain distance from the user's location or from a specified address.
				\item \textbf{G4} The system enables user to reserve a single available car in a certain geographical region for one hour before the user picks it up.
				\item \textbf{G5} If the reserved car is not picked up within one hour from the reservation time, the reservation expires and the system tag this car as available. The system charges user a fee of 1 EUR. 
				\item \textbf{G6} When the user tells the system that he's near the reserved car, the system unlocks the car to let the user enter.  

				%% Madda's part %%
				\item \textbf{G7} The system charges the user for a predefined amount of money per minute.
				\item \textbf{G8} The system starts charging the user as soon as the car ignites.
				\item \textbf{G9} The system stops charging the user when the car is parked in a safe area and the user exits the car. The user must confirm the operation, otherwise the system keeps charging them. 
				\item \textbf{G10} A screen on the car notifies the user of the current charges.
				\item \textbf{G11} The system locks the car automatically when the user exits the car inside a safe area.  
				\item \textbf{G12} If the user has chosen to keep being charged, the system allows them to exit and close and re-open the car through a bluetooth system. %FIXME is this a goal????
				\item \textbf{G13} If the user has chosen to stop being charged, the system keeps a 10–minutes window of time when they are allowed to re-open the car if it has not already been reserved by someone else.
				\item \textbf{G14} The set of safe parking areas is pre–defined by the management system.
				\item \textbf{G15} The system allows the user to earn a 10\% discount for the current ride if there are at least two other passengers in the car.

				%% Poe's part %%
				\item \textbf{G16} The system applies a 20\% discount on the current ride if the car is returned by the user with more than 50\% of power charge.
				\item \textbf{G17} If a user returns a car to a recharging safe area and plugs it into the power grid, the system applies a 30\% discount on his current ride.
				\item \textbf{G18} The system applies a 30\% sanction on the current ride if the car is returned in a safe area at more than 3 km from the nearest recharging safe area.
				\item \textbf{G19} The system applies a 30\% sanction on the current ride if the car is returned with less than 20\% of power charge.
				\item \textbf{G20} The system provides an option (\textit{money saving}) to get information about the best safe area where the user can leave the car. The best safe area ensures a uniform distribution of cars among the city and takes into account the destination and the nature of the safe areas (recharging or not). % FIXME is it clear?
				\item \textbf{G21} In \textit{money saving option}, the system applies a certain discount for the current ride if the car is returned in the suggested safe area. % FIXME "certain" is ok?
				\item \textbf{G22} Cars returned with less then 20\% of power charge are recharged within 1 day. % to keep car used (probably need a maintenance guy)
				% TODO don't know if goes here: if a car breaks or is left outside the boundaries, it is recovered.
				
				
				%Additional goals
				\item \textbf{G1} The system notifies the user of the final charges on their smartphone as soon as 10 minutes passes or another user reserves a car. %not sure of formulation
				%TODO add how to lock/unlock car when outside safe area?
