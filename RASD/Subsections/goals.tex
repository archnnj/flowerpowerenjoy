				\item The system allows guests to register; to complete the registration procedure the system sends a password to the guest as an access key.
				\item The system should enable a registered user to find the location of an available car within a certain distance from the user's location or from a specified address.
				\item The system enables user to reserve a single available car in a certain geographical region for one hour before the user picks it up. If the car is not picked up by that time, the reservation expires, the system tags this car as available again and it charges the user a fine of 1 EUR.
				
				\item The system should allow the user to employ a car in a proper and safe way. 				
								
				\item The system charges the user for a predefined amount of money per minute. A screen on the car notifies the user of the current charges.
				\item The system starts charging the user as soon as the car ignites. It stops charging them when the car is parked in a safe area and the user exits the car.
				\item The system should encourage good user behaviour through the application of discounts to the fee per minute. 
				\item The system should discourage bad behaviour through the application of sanctions to the fee per minute. 
				\item The system should provide an alternative usage mode for cars called \textit{money saving option}. Besides aiding the user in saving money, this mode allows for a uniform distribution of cars throughout the city by suggesting the user where to park.
				\item The system allows the company to assist the users in case of need and take care of the cars.				
				\item The admin should be able to configure some parameters of the system.
