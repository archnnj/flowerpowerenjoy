	In this section we will show the component interfaces for all the macro-components already showed in the Component View chapter. Some of them have been used in the Sequence Diagrams, where their use can be drawn more clearly. As for the others, we believe them to be self-explanatory so we will not go into details about them. We need to keep in mind that for the further implementations, these functions can be splitted into less complex ones.
