In this section we will use the COCOMO II approach in order to estimate the cost and effort required by \textit{PowerEnJoy}'s development. \\

We will use the results drawn in \autoref{sec:FP} and the estimated Source Lines of Code to use as values in COCOMO II equations. To decide on the values of scale factors and cost drivers, we will refer to the official COCOMO II manual (see \autoref{sec:references} for hyperlink and further detail). The reference tables will be re-drawn for readability in each section, referencing them as \textit{"CII modelman"}.\\

The following equations will be used to calculate the effort (in persons month) and duration (in months) of our project:

		\paragraph{}\(Effort = A \times EAF \times KSLOC^E\)\\
wherein
		\paragraph{}\(E = B + 0.01 \times \sum_{j=1}^{5}SF_j\)\\
is the exponent (B is a constant that in COCOMO II has value $B=0.91$), A is a constant that in COCOMO II has value $A=2.94$, and
		\paragraph{}\(EAF = \prod_{i=1}^{17}CD_i \).\\

For the duration, we will use the following formula:
		\paragraph{}\(Duration = C \times Effort^F\)\\
where $C=3.67$ and
		\paragraph{}\(F = D + 0.2 \times (E - B) = 0.28 + 0.2 \times ( E - 0.91 )\).


\subsubsection{Scale Factors}

Scale factors (SF) are used to "account for the relative economies or diseconomies of scale encountered for software projects of different sizes" [Banker et al. 1994]. They are used to calculate the exponent E and there are five of them:\\

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | }
		\multicolumn{7}{c}{\textbf{Scale Factor values, $SF_j$}}\\
		\hline
		\textbf{Scale Factors} & \textbf{Very Low} & \textbf{Low} & \textbf{Nominal} & \textbf{High} & \textbf{Very High} & \textbf{Extra High}\\ \hline
		
		\textbf{PREC} & thoroughly unprecedented & largely unprecedented & somewhat unprecedented & generally familiar & largely familiar & thoroughly familiar \\
		$SF_j$ & 6.20 & 4.96 & 3.72 & 2.48 & 1.24 & 0.00\\ \hline
		
		\textbf{FLEX} & rigorous & occasional relaxation & some relaxation & general conformity & some conformity & general goals\\
		$SF_j$ & 5.07 & 4.05 & 3.04 & 2.03 & 1.01 & 0.00\\ \hline
		
		\textbf{RESL} & little (20\%) & some (40\%) & often (60\%) & generally (75\%) & mostly (90\%) & full (100\%)\\
		$SF_j$ & 7.07 & 5.65 & 4.24 & 2.83 & 1.41 & 0.00\\ \hline
		
		\textbf{TEAM} & very difficult interactions & some difficult interactions & basically cooperative interactions & largely cooperative & highly cooperative & seamless interactions\\
		$SF_j$ & 5.48 & 4.38 & 3.29 & 2.19 & 1.10 & 0.00\\ \hline
		
		\textbf{PMAT} & Level 1 Lower & Level 1 Upper & Level 2 & Level 3 & Level 4 & Level 5\\
		$SF_j$ & 7.80 & 6.24 & 4.68 & 3.12 & 1.56 & 0.00\\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}


Here is an explanation of each Scale Factor and our choices:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{PREC}: Precedentedness describes "if a product is similar to several previously developed projects"\footnote{CII modelman, page 18}. While on the one hand we have no experience with this kind of system, it is also true that we won't need particular innovation and that similar system have been developed before. For these reasons, this factor is set to \textbf{Nominal}.
	\item \textbf{FLEX}: Flexibility describes the need for the software to conform to pre-established requirements and law. This factor is set to \textbf{Very Low}, meaning we have close to no flexibility in regards of either our requirements or state law regarding car driving and payments. Some (very) occasional relaxation may occur in the development of the company requirements. 
	\item \textbf{RESL}: Architecture/Risk Resolution describes our awareness and preparedness with respect to risks; in particular it focuses on architecture and how much interest it has been given to its design and its uncertainties. We believe we have analysed as best as possible the risks inherent to our architecture, hence the value is set to \textbf{High}.
	\item \textbf{TEAM}: Team Cohesion accounts for "the sources of project turbulence and entropy because of difficulties in synchronizing the projectâ€™s stakeholders"\footnote{CII modelman, page 20}. We believe our team is cohesive, although it presents a language barrier problem. So this factor is set to \textbf{Very High}.
	\item \textbf{PMAT}: We believe that our inexperience in this kind of project allows for a pretty low project maturity. On the other hand we had only little problems during the planning stages of the project. To account for both those aspects, we set the value of this factor to \textbf{Low}. 
\end{itemize}


To sum up our decisions, here is the following summary table:\\

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Scale Driver} & \textbf{Factor} & \textbf{Value}\\ \hline
		
		PREC & Nominal & 3.72\\
		FLEX & Very Low & 5.07\\
		RESL & High & 2.83\\
		TEAM & Very High & 1.10\\
		PMAT & Low & 6.24\\ \hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Total:} & 18.96\\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}



\subsubsection{Post-Architecture Cost Drivers}
There are seventeen post-architecture cost drivers, which are multipliers used in COCOMO II in order to adjust the "nominal" effort in person-months in order to take into consideration the software under development. Nominal effort is defined as the effort estimated only using scale factors. 

	\subsubsection*{Product Factors}
	Product factors are needed to account for the variations in the effort required caused by the characteristics of the software under development. There are five of them:
	
	
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{RELY}: RELY measures the "extent to which the software must perform its intended
function over a period of time"\footnote{CII modelman, page 25}. We decided to set it to \textbf{High} in order to keep into consideration the potential finantial losses caused by an accident in the car (even though the car itself is not driven by the system, a failure in notifying some problems with it may have undesired effects) and consequent risks to the driver. 
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | }
				\hline
				\textbf{RELY Descriptors} & slight inconvenience & low, easily recoverable losses & moderate, easily recoverable losses & high financial loss & risk to human life & \\ \hline
			
				\textbf{Rating levels} & Very Low & Low & Nominal & High & Very High & Extra High\\ \hline
			
				\textbf{Effort multipliers} & 0.82 & 0.92 & 1.00 & 1.10 & 1.26 & n/a\\ \hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		
		
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{DATA}: this cost driver tries to "capture the effect large test data requirements have on
product development"\footnote{CII modelman, page 26}. It is determined by calculating D/P, i.e. the size of the test database in bytes on the SLOC of the program. We have estimated our test database to be in the order of magnitude of 10 megabytes ($10^7 bytes$). Even if we count our SLOC with the average estimation of $\sim 9K SLOC$, the result is greater than 1000. Hence, the value of the cost driver DATA for us is \textbf{Very High}.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | }
				\hline
				\textbf{DATA Descriptors} & & $D/P < 10 $ & $ 10 \leq D/P < 100$ & $ 100 \leq D/P < 1000$ & $DP \geq 1000$ & \\ \hline
			
				\textbf{Rating levels} & Very Low & Low & Nominal & High & Very High & Extra High\\ \hline
			
				\textbf{Effort multipliers} & n/a & 0.90 & 1.00 & 1.14 & 1.28 & n/a\\ \hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		
		
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{CPLX}: Product Complexity is evaluated based on 5 factors, which are control operations, computational operations, device-dependent operations, data management operations, user interface management operations. Since we expect to have fairly complex operations concerning computation, devices, data management and user interface management, the complexity is set to \textbf{High}.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | }
				\hline
				\textbf{Rating levels} & Very Low & Low & Nominal & High & Very High & Extra High\\ \hline
			
				\textbf{Effort multipliers} & 0.73 & 0.87 & 1.00 & 1.17 & 1.34 & 1.74\\ \hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		
		
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{RUSE}: RUSE means Developed for Reusability. This cost driver was set to \textbf{Nominal} since we probably won't need the additional effort required to develop components for reusability outside of the project itself.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | }
				\hline
				\textbf{RUSE Descriptors} & & none & across project & across program & across product line & across multiple product lines\\ \hline
			
				\textbf{Rating levels} & Very Low & Low & Nominal & High & Very High & Extra High\\ \hline
			
				\textbf{Effort multipliers} & n/a & 0.95 & 1.00 & 1.07 & 1.15 & 1.24\\ \hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		
		
		

		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{DOCU}: the DOCU cost driver accounts for the dimensioning of the documentation with respect to the life-cycle needs. This driver is set to very low if the documentation is next to none and very high if the documentation is excessive. We set this value to \textbf{Nominal}.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | }
				\hline
				\textbf{DOCU Descriptors} & Many life-cycle needs uncovered & Some life-cycle needs uncovered & Right-sized to life-cycle needs & Excessive for life-cycle needs & Very excessive for life-cycle needs & \\ \hline
			
				\textbf{Rating levels} & Very Low & Low & Nominal & High & Very High & Extra High\\ \hline
			
				\textbf{Effort multipliers} & 0.81 & 0.91 & 1.00 & 1.11 & 1.23 & n/a\\ \hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		
	
	
	\subsubsection*{Platform Factors}
	Platform Factors take in consideration the complexity of hardware and infrastructure software needed for the system. 
	
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{TIME}: the TIME factor measures the Execution Time Constraint imposed upon a software system. Since \textit{PowerEnJoy} is quite a complex system, we expect %TODO choose a value!
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | }
				\hline
				\textbf{TIME Descriptors} & & & $\leq$50\% use of available execution time & 70\% use of available execution time & 85\% use of available execution time & 95\% use of available execution time\\ \hline
			
				\textbf{Rating levels} & Very Low & Low & Nominal & High & Very High & Extra High\\ \hline
			
				\textbf{Effort multipliers} & n/a & n/a & 1.00 & 1.11 & 1.29 & 1.63\\ \hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		
		
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{STOR}: it represents the degree of Main Storage Constraint imposed on a system. Having a relatively small test database and being commercially available many storage units that can contain Terabytes of data, we don't believe storage will be a serious matter for us. Hence, this driver is set to \textbf{Nominal}.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | C{2cm} | }
				\hline
				\textbf{STOR Descriptors} & & & $\leq$50\% use of available storage & 70\% use of available storage & 85\% use of available storage & 95\% use of available storage\\ \hline
			
				\textbf{Rating levels} & Very Low & Low & Nominal & High & Very High & Extra High\\ \hline
			
				\textbf{Effort multipliers} & n/a & n/a & 1.00 & 1.05 & 1.17 & 1.46\\ \hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		
		
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{PVOL}: The PVOL accounts for the volatility of the platforms on which the system is deployed. We believe that the clients operating systems may perform major updates than once a year; it is also true that we don't expect our other platforms to change often. For these reasons, we decided to set the PVOL value to \textbf{Nominal}.
