This section is intended to provide an estimation of the expected size, cost and effort required by \textit{PowerEnJoy}. We will exploit algorithmic techniques to make these estimations; we will use Function Points to appraise the size of the future system, taking into account only the business logic and its functionalities, without taking into consideration the user view. For the cost and effort estimation we will use the COCOMO approach, using the LOC result from the FP approach as a starting point for its calculations.
