\subsection{Purpose and scope}
	The present document is the Project Plan Document for the PowerEnJoy system. It aims to analyze the dimension of the project and the effort required, to guide and assist the management of all the involved processes. \newline
	In \textit{section 2}, a post-architecture analysis of project dimensions is performed, in terms of lines of code (LOC), applying the Function Point (FP) approach. This evaluation is then used to predict the actual effort the project will require, using the COCOMO II framework. The results can be used as reference parameters to update the budget evaluation and provide an estimate of the resource allocation.\newline
	\textit{Section 3} and \textit{section 4} take into account the effort estimation to provide a possible schedule and a human resource allocation for the project.\newline
	Finally, \textit{section 5} conducts an analysis of the most critical risks the project may face, trying to describe the preventive contingency plans to be adopted.
