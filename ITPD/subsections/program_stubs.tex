	\subsection{Program Stubs and Drivers}
	
	As we mentioned in \autoref{sec:integration_testing_strategy}, we are going to use a bottom-up approach to integrate and test all components of the system. This means that on the one hand we need a series of drivers to perform the method invocations while the higher-level components still haven't been developed; on the other hand, we don't need stubs since any lower-level component whose method needs to be invoked already exists at that point in the project development. The only exception to this represent the three critical components identified in \autoref{sec:integration_testing_strategy}: \textit{Car Manager}, \textit{Money Saving Option Manager} and \textit{Payment Manager}.

	\subsection{Test Data}
	
	In order to perform the tests specified in \autoref{sec: individual_steps} we will need a range of test data, both valid and invalid. This chapter will list those data in reference to the specific component (or subsystem) that will need them. %FIXIT subsystem????
	
	
	
		\subsubsection{Employment}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A list of valid and invalid \textbf{Reservations}. The set should contain instances exhibiting the following cases:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Null object
					\item Null fields

					\item Starting time for the reservation set in the future
					\item Reservation on a car that is being used
					\item Reservation on a nonexistent car
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A list of valid and invalid \textbf{Rides}. The set should contain instances exhibiting the following cases:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Null object
					\item Null fields
					\item Ride that has already ended
					\item Ride on a car that is already being used
					\item Ride on a nonexistent car
					\item Ride associated with a user already using another car
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		
		
		
		\subsubsection{Money Saving Option}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A list of valid and invalid \textbf{destinations}. The set should contain instances exhibiting the following cases:

					\item Destination is outside city boundaries
					\item Destination has no parking areas within the radius requested by the MSO
					\item Destination doesn't exist
					\item Destination is the car's current location
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		
		
		
		\subsubsection{Backend}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A list of valid and invalid \textbf{Parameters}. The set should contain instances exhibiting the following cases:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Null object
					\item Null fields
					\item Parameter value outside allowed range
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A list of valid and invalid \textbf{Emergency Reports}. The set should contain instances exhibiting the following cases:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Null object
					\item Null fields
					\item Report closed
					\item Report without User assigned
					\item Report without Car assigned
					\item Report without Operator assigned
					\item Report with an available Operator assigned
				\end{itemize}
