	\subsection{Program Stubs and Drivers}
	
	As we mentioned in \autoref{sec:integration_testing_strategy}, we are going to use a bottom-up approach to integrate and test all macro-components of the system. This means that on the one hand we need a series of drivers to perform the method invocations while the higher-level components still haven't been developed. On the other hand, while it's true that in general we don't need stubs since the lower-level components will have been developed before testing the following level, in \autoref{sec:integration_testing_strategy} we specified that three macro-components needed a critical-first approach: these are the \textbf{Money Saving Option Manager}, the \textbf{Car Manager} and the \textbf{Payment Manager}. In the developing of these components we will start by integrating the most critical subcomponent and then the remaining ones. For these reason, the \textbf{Car Manager} integration and the \textbf{Money Saving Option Manager} integration will require drivers (since their critical component is the most low-level one); on the contrary, the \textbf{Payment Manager} will require the definition of stubs to simulate the potential invoked functions.
	For the specifics of each method invocation performed by the drivers, please refer to \autoref{sec: individual_steps}.
		
		\subsubsection{Stubs}
				
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{â€¢} %TODO PAYMENT MANAGER
			\end{itemize}
		
		
		\subsubsection{Drivers}
		
		Here follows a list of drivers needed by the system to perform testing according to our strategy. Following the bottom-up approach, drivers for subcomponents will be provided when needed as well as drivers emulating macrocomponents.
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{User Manager Driver} %TODO user mgmt driver
			\item \textbf{Car Manager Driver} %TODO car mgmt driver
			\item \textbf{Access Manager Driver} %TODO 
			\item \textbf{Parking Manager Driver}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Sensors Manager} and \textbf{Car Location Handler} subcomponents. %written too little??
			\item \textbf{MSO Manager Driver}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Parking  Manager} and \textbf{Car Location Handler} subcomponents.
			\item \textbf{Car Employment Manager}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Parking  Manager}, \textbf{Car Location Handler}, \textbf{User Handler} and \textbf{Car Handler} subcomponents.
			\item \textbf{Reservation Handler}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Time   Manager} subcomponent.
			\item \textbf{Reservation Handler}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Time   Manager} and \textbf{Reservation Handler} subcomponents.
			\item \textbf{Emergency Report Handler}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Report Status Handler} subcomponent.
			\item \textbf{Operators Handler}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Emergency Report Handler} subcomponent.
			\item \textbf{Dispatch Manager}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Operators Handler} subcomponent.
			\textbf{Admin Handler}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Dispatch Manager} and \textbf{Backend Manager} subcomponents.
			\textbf{Payment Manager}: %TODO

	\subsection{Test Data}
	
	In order to perform the tests specified in \autoref{sec: individual_steps} we will need a range of test data, both valid and invalid. This chapter will list those data in reference to the specific component (or subsystem) that will need them. %FIXIT subsystem????
