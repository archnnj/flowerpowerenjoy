	\subsection{Program Stubs and Drivers}
	
	As we mentioned in \autoref{sec:integration_testing_strategy}, we are going to use a bottom-up approach to integrate and test all macro-components of the system. This means that on the one hand we need a series of drivers to perform the method invocations while the higher-level components still haven't been developed. On the other hand, while it's true that in general we don't need stubs since the lower-level components will have been developed before testing the following level, in \autoref{sec:integration_testing_strategy} we specified that three macro-components needed a critical-first approach: these are the \textbf{Money Saving Option Manager}, the \textbf{Car Manager} and the \textbf{Payment Manager}. In the developing of these components we will not integrate their sub-components with the bottom-up approach, hence we will need stubs to simulate the potential invoked function.
	For the specifics of each method invocation performed by the drivers, please refer to \autoref{sec: individual_steps}.
		
		\subsubsection{Stubs}
		
		Here follows a list of stubs needed by the system to perform testing according to our strategy.
		
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Sensors Stub}: this stub will simulate every possible answer to a method invocation by the \textbf{Car Handler}, which is the most critical. %are we sure??? It's the sensors manager that interacts with the car afterall
				\item \textbf{Parking Distribution Stub}: this stub will simulate every answer to a method invocation performed by the \textbf{MSO Handler}: since it's the Handler that deals with the brunt of the computation for the Money Saving Option, it must be able to deal with every possible criticality and wrong data coming from the Parking Distribution Handler.
				\item \textbf{â€¢} %TODO PAYMENT MANAGER
			\end{itemize}
		
		
		\subsubsection{Drivers}
		
		Here follows a list of drivers needed by the system to perform testing according to our strategy. Following the bottom-up approach, drivers for subcomponents will be provided when needed as well as drivers emulating macrocomponents.
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{User Manager Driver} %TODO user mgmt driver
			\item \textbf{Car Manager Driver} %TODO car mgmt driver
			\item \textbf{Access Manager Driver} %TODO 
			\item \textbf{Parking Manager Driver}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Sensors Manager} and \textbf{Car Location Handler} subcomponents. %written too little??
			\item \textbf{MSO Manager Driver}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Parking  Manager} and \textbf{Car Location Handler} subcomponents.
			\item \textbf{Car Employment Manager}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Parking  Manager}, \textbf{Car Location Handler}, \textbf{User Handler} and \textbf{Car Handler} subcomponents.
			\item \textbf{Reservation Handler}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Time   Manager} subcomponent.
			\item \textbf{Reservation Handler}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Time   Manager} and \textbf{Reservation Handler} subcomponents.
			\item \textbf{Emergency Report Handler}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Report Status Handler} subcomponent.
			\item \textbf{Operators Handler}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Emergency Report Handler} subcomponent.
			\item \textbf{Dispatch Manager}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Operators Handler} subcomponent.
			\textbf{Admin Handler}: this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Dispatch Manager} and \textbf{Backend Manager} subcomponents.
			\textbf{Payment Manager}: %TODO
		\end{itemize}
		
	
	
	
	\subsection{Test Data}
	
	In order to perform the tests specified in \autoref{sec: individual_steps} we will need a range of test data, both valid and invalid. This chapter will list those data in reference to the specific component (or subsystem) that will need them. %FIXIT subsystem????
