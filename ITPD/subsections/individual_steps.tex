	This section contains a detailed description of the tests to be performed on each pair of components that need to be integrated. Those pairs will be identified by a $< caller, called >$ coupled notation that will contain every method called by the $< caller >$ on the $< called >$. 
%	We will follow the bottom-up approach (with partial critical-first approach) as we mentioned in the integration strategy.
